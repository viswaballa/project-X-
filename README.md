## *Project title: PROJECT X*

* Team members: Viswa Balla, Matt Kania, Adeyemi Thomas, Colin Cheesman

## *Project description/outline:*
    We believe that if we look at recent housing market trends, income growth and the change in stock prices of publicly-listed home construction companies, then we
    can predict the future direction of the U.S. housing market.  

## *Research questions to answer:*
    What has been the trend in U.S. housing prices over the past ~5 years?  
    Is there any relationship between wage growth and housing prices? What do recent trends in wage growth versus housing prices indicate about future housing prices?
    Is there any relationship between the stock prices of publicly-listed home construction companies and housing prices? What can we glean from the change in stock 
    prices over the past five years

## *Datasets to be used:*
    Zillow 
    Alpaca
    HV.PLOT

## Question 1:
    What has been the trend in U.S. housing prices over the past ~5 years? 

## Findings:
    U.S. housing prices have increased ~4x over the past five or so years. While their rise has started to slow more recently, they remain at recent highs and have
    room to fall further relative to historical levels.

------------------------------

## Question 2: 
    Is there any relationship between wage growth and housing prices? What do recent trends in wage growth versus housing prices indicate about future housing prices? 

## Findings:
    There is a moderate positive correlation between wages and housing prices, however we were not able to analyze a long enough time period to be confident in this
    view. Interestingly, housing prices have risen at a much faster rate than wages over the past 5 years, indicating that housing affordability could be a problem.

-----------------

## Question 3:
    Is there any relationship between the stock prices of publicly-listed home construction companies and housing prices? What can we glean from the change in stock
    prices over the past five years?

## Findings: 
    We found the stock prices of home construction companies are more volatile than the change in housing prices. There doesnâ€™t appear to be a strong correlation,
    however we note that housing price growth began to slow a little more than 6 months after the stock prices declined. So, the stock prices may be a leading
    indicator of home prices, but we would need to observe a longer time period as well as consider other potential influencing factors to have conviction in this view
