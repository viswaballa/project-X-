## *Project title: PROJECT X*

* Team members: Viswa Balla, Matt Kania, Adeyemi Thomas, Colin Cheesman

## *Project description/outline:*
    Our project is to uncover what helps determine the strength of the housing market. We'll examine the relationship between US home prices and: 1) several economic datapoints; 2) the stock prices of construction companies.  

## *Research questions to answer:*
    What economic indicators are correlated with the strength of the housing market (wage growth, housing inventory)?  
    Do the stock prices of construction companies tell us anything about future home prices? 


## *Datasets to be used:*
    Zillow 
    Alpaca
    HV.PLOT 


## Questions:
    What has been the trend in U.S. housing prices from 2018-2022? In what areas have prices increased the most? Anything else to show the trends in housing over the years?
