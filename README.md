Project title: PROJECT X

## Team members: Viswa Balla, Matt Kania, Adeyemi Thomas, Colin Cheesman

## Project description/outline:
 Our project is to uncover what helps determine the strength of the housing market. Weâ€™ll examine the relationship between US home prices and: 1) several economic datapoints; 2) the stock prices of construction companies.  

## Research questions to answer:
What economic indicators are correlated with the strength of the housing market (wage growth, housing inventory)?  
Do the stock prices of construction companies tell us anything about future home prices? 


## Datasets to be used:
Zillow 
Alpaca 


## Questions/Outline:
What has been the trend in U.S. housing prices from 2018-2022? In what areas have prices increased the most? Anything else to show the trends in housing over the years? 
-----------------------------------------------
Data: zillow housing price index, zillow housing inventory

Chart ideas: line plot of Zillow housing price index over the period, bar chart of Zillow housing price index change each year, hv.plot.points of the change in housing prices by region (that geographic map with color of bubble showing the change in price over the period)

## LINE PLOT OF ZILLOW HOUSING PRICE INDEX OVER 2018-2022
## BAR CHARTR OF ZILLOW HOUSING PRICE INDEX CHANGE EACH YEAR
## HV.PLOT.POINTS GEOGRAPHIC MAP WITH BUBBLE COLORS (FIND DATA THAT INCLUDES LAT / LONG) 

QUESTION: Using this data what trend can we see with the housing prices over 4 years. Can we determine the direction of the housing market? 
Are we heading towards a housing market collapse?
