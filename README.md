## *Project description/outline:*
    Our project is to uncover what helps determine the strength of the housing market. We'll examine the relationship between US home prices and:
    1) several economic datapoints; 2) the stock prices of construction companies.  

## *Research questions to answer:*
    What economic indicators are correlated with the strength of the housing market (wage growth, housing inventory)?  
    Do the stock prices of construction companies tell us anything about future home prices? 


## *Datasets to be used:*
    Zillow 
    Alpaca
    HV.PLOT 

-------------------------

## Question 1:
    What has been the trend in U.S. housing prices from 2018-2022? In what areas have prices increased the most? 
    Anything else to show the trends in housing over the years?

## Question 2: 
    Using this data what trend can we see with the housing prices over 4 years. Can we determine the direction of the housing market?
